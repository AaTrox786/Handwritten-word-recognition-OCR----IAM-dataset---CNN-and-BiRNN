add a very detailed readme file, with links to
1. what this is?
2. description of the data and where to find it?
3. how the data was pre-processed and why seperate split (text) files were created?
3. decisions behind the architecture and loss function? how and where this was trained? (also include/point to the image of architecture)
4. how this can be resued? (include functions to pre-process an image for inference and for inference from command line)
5. include all that didn't work or wasn't working in a seperate branch. e.g. optimised to different loss function and another RNN type(only include GRU or LSTM in master branch)
6.
